# Publish Prefixes Extension for ExpressionEngine 2.x

### Overview

Publish Prefixes lets you tame unweildy publish and edit menus by grouping channels by using prefixes. 

Say for example you had multiple 'Product' channels... you can group them all under a single parent 'Product' menu item by prefixing the channel names with 'Products: '

For example, if your channel names were:

Clocks
Widgets
Tools

You'd rename them to

Products: Clocks
Products: Widgets
Products: Tools

This would create a Parent menu item called Products, with Clocks, Widgets and Tools as the child items.

Simple.
